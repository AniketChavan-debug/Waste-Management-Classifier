# Waste Management Classifier using Python and CVZone

This project demonstrates a real-time **Waste Management Classifier** that uses **Python** and **CVZone** for detecting and categorizing different types of waste. The classifier is built using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** and optimized for deployment in smart waste disposal systems.

## Features
- Classifies waste into categories such as **Plastic**, **Paper**, **Metal**, and **Organic**.
- Utilizes **real-time image processing** using a webcam.
- Built using **CVZone** for easy integration with computer vision models.
- Can be deployed in **smart waste management systems** for efficient waste sorting.

## Components
1. **Python** - Programming language used for implementation.
2. **CVZone** - Computer vision library for image classification.
3. **TensorFlow/Keras** - Deep learning framework for training the classification model.
4. **OpenCV** - Used for real-time video capturing and image processing.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training consists of images of waste items, categorized into **Plastic**, **Paper**, **Metal**, and **Organic** categories. The images are resized to 224x224 and normalized for training.
